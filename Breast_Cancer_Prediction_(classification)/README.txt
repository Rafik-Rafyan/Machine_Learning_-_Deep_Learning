BREAST CANCER PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING.


DESCRIPTION:

This project aims to predict breast cancer using KNN algorithm. 
In the project has been used dataset with following columns:

mean radius
mean texture
mean perimeter
mean area
mean smoothness
mean compactness
mean concavity
mean concave points
mean symmetry
mean fractal
dimension
radius error
texture error
perimeter error
area error
smoothness error
compactness error
concavity error
concave points error
symmetry error
fractal dimension error
worst radius
worst texture
worst perimeter
worst area
worst smoothness
worst compactness
worst concavity
worst concave points
worst symmetry
worst fractal dimension
Cancer (target column)

Feature engineering techniques, such as scaling and handling outliers, are applied to preprocess the data before training the models.

DEPENDENCIES:
- Python 3.12.3
- scikit-learn
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

Model provides 91 percent accuracy.
